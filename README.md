# HelpHer Menstrual problems are a common, yet often disregarded, aspect of women's health. Every month, millions of women deal with a variety of menstrual issues that can negatively affect their standard of life and interfere with daily activities. The most pressing issue that women face during menstruation is the need for easily available medical stores and hygienic restrooms. Several necessities are necessary in order to address the immediate needs of women who are menstruating. However, finding the nearest and most convenient pharmacy or restrooms could be difficult and occasionally time-consuming.
# The purpose of the project is to present a novel approach to these pressing problems. We suggest creating a state-of-the-art algorithmic method that will expedite the process of locating clean restrooms and medical supply businesses within a preset radius. This strategy will ultimately help women in their time of need by reducing the inconvenience they experience when attempting to locate the amenities they require during their menstruation.
